This is a simple typing speed test app built using React that measures how fast a user can type in a given time frame. The app provides users with a text prompt, which they must type as quickly and accurately as possible. The user's typing speed is measured in words per minute (WPM), which is displayed on the screen at the end of the test.

# Features:

A simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to easily start and complete the typing test.

A timer that counts down from a user-specified time limit.

A word counter that keeps track of the number of words typed by the user during the test.

An accurate and reliable WPM calculator that displays the user's typing speed at the end of the test.

A leaderboard that shows the top scores achieved by other users of the app.

A responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
